    <details><summary>Beta scope and service limits</summary>
    <p>U.S. books use USD. Canadian CAD admission is on hold. No foreign exchange or consolidated cross-currency reporting, tax filing, payroll, bank feeds or unverified depreciation operations are offered.</p>
    <p>Beta receipts require customer-owned Google Drive. Ordinary bookkeeping and receipts may be used only after a separately approved release. Do not submit passwords, tokens, government IDs, full payment-card credentials, medical information or other unnecessary sensitive data.</p>
    <p>Support is best-effort with a target first response within two business days and weekly defect triage; no fix-time or 24/7 SLA. Independent database and receipt recovery targets of 24 hours and full-service recovery within 48 hours remain unverified. Your operator must provide the reviewed policies and contact channel before enrollment.</p>
