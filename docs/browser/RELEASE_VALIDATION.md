# Release validation and Streamlit transition

Automated browser journeys exercise synthetic fixtures through the compiled browser,
HTTP application services and disposable PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL owns ledger authority
and DocumentStore owns bytes; workflows must not depend on Streamlit session/rerun state.

Named-user hosted acceptance follows [hosted rollout](../identity/HOSTED_ROLLOUT.md),
including real-provider, rollback and manual browser/accessibility evidence. Owner use
follows [controlled cutover](../accounting/CUTOVER.md). These are separate from automated
regression coverage and the completed historical technical-alpha acceptance.

## Exact default workflow matrix

Automated cases use a fixed synthetic identity and byte adapter. Hosted acceptance
applies these workflows to authorized named fixtures and the real configured provider
under hosted rollout; synthetic context or bytes cannot supply that hosted evidence.

| Required workflow | New-stack surface and owner | Release evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resolve business/reference setup | Server-scoped entity context; Accounts, Categories, Payees, Tags (entity and reference workflows) | Fixed synthetic test context and rejected foreign entity; create two bank accounts, expense/income categories, payee and tag. Local/native two-business switching and isolation remain in browser testing. |
| Ordinary transaction lifecycle | Transactions (core bookkeeping workflows and protected browser mutations) | Expense/income/transfer create, loaded edit, fresh confirmed delete; reference/tag selections; transfer excluded from income/expenses. |
| Journal lifecycle | Add journal/Journals (core bookkeeping workflows and protected browser mutations) | Unbalanced save disabled; balanced posting create, edit, grouped ledger read and confirmed delete. |
| Protected mutations | Existing loaded-baseline forms (protected browser mutations) | Two independently loaded browsers; stale edit and delete rejected, draft preserved, missing edit/delete baseline rejected, explicit latest-record reload. The broader reference/merge matrix remains in browser testing CI. |
| Ledger/core reports | Transactions, Dashboard/Reports (core bookkeeping workflows) | Four complete entries visible; report deltas include journal expense and exclude transfer; Assets = Liabilities + Equity; mobile ledger fits its scroll region. |
| Essential document flow | Saved transaction receipts (receipt workflows) | Synthetic fixture DocumentStore: upload/attach, exact-byte download, reference-only unlink, retained-file relink and final unlink. browser testing CI retains controlled partial-link/uncertain-upload/failure tests. |
| Runtime/release | Version, readiness, deployment (deployment) | Exact release SHA, anonymous restrictions, routing, real DB-backed account read; ordered schema step and compatible application rollback evidence. |
| Browser quality | Bounded browser testing suite plus selected hosted acceptance | Chromium/Firefox/WebKit, 1440x1000 and 390x844; current-candidate CI plus separate hosted results and manual device record. |

Mileage (mileage workflows) is available as an additional manual log, but is not
promoted into the default alpha gate. Recurring/mixed-use (recurring and mixed-use
workflows) and assets/depreciation (asset workflows) remain outside that gate. If a
release or live owner cutover owner matrix needs them, name the additional workflows and
require the corresponding completed slice and evidence.

## Automated journey and supported deployment boundaries

The hosted synthetic staging CLI and **Technical alpha staging gate** dispatch workflow
are retired. Do not restore Basic access on named staging to run historical tooling.
Historical exact-candidate acceptance, provider limitations, receipt persistence and
rollback evidence remain in the [owning technical-alpha
discussion](https://github.com/Roklion/Project_Tabula_Rasa/issues/288#issuecomment-6117319756).
That acceptance is unchanged and does not certify a new release.

The reusable journey lives in `tests/postgres/browser_journey.py` and is exercised by
`tests/postgres/test_browser_journey.py` against disposable real PostgreSQL, the compiled
browser, actual HTTP/services, a synthetic byte adapter and a second entity. Required CI
preserves Chromium/Firefox/WebKit at 1440x1000 and 390x844, bookkeeping and accounting
assertions, stale/missing-baseline mutations, receipt retention, delayed mutations,
failure handling and entity isolation. Helper guards remain covered separately. See
[browser testing](TESTING.md) for local setup and CI ownership. There is no hosted write
entry point in test support. Automated success does not establish real-provider,
retained-data, rollback, physical-device or manual accessibility acceptance.

[Development promotion](../operations/DEPLOYMENT.md) remains supported with restricted-alpha
authentication, its fixed synthetic identity and authenticated read-only smoke checks.
Target binding, explicit migrations and immutable-image verification retain their
existing owners. [Synthetic receipt storage](../storage/STAGING_RECEIPTS.md) remains
explicitly configured per environment with independent grant/profile/folder custody and
isolation/security checks. Native fixtures continue to use `TrustedDevelopmentContext`.
These consumers do not require the retired hosted acceptance runner.

## Compatible application rollback rehearsal

Reuse deployment's [promotion/failure/rollback
procedure](../operations/DEPLOYMENT.md#promotion-failure-and-rollback). Select a
verified retained prior digest with the same schema head and passing main CI, and
authorize a controlled staging maintenance window. Record current and prior
digests/release IDs, then dispatch the normal staging promotion to the prior compatible
digest. Its ordered migration check, registry/Render integrity, readiness and browser
smoke must pass. Promote the selected candidate again, verify the same evidence, and
repeat the selected named-user hosted acceptance checks. Retain both workflow links
and operator observations proving the retained DB/receipt data survived. A real rollback deployment is required;
mocks or a repeated current-image promotion do not rehearse rollback.

Do not introduce a bad bookkeeping write or destructive schema failure just to test
rollback. Do not automatically downgrade/stamp/restore the DB. Incompatible schemas
require the PostgreSQL persistence reviewed bridge/maintenance/forward-repair policy;
database/document disaster recovery remains platform operations and commercial recovery
agreement. An uncertain deploy stops for inspection under existing deployment rules.

## Feature routing and authority during transition

| Workflow | Browser/API availability | Remaining internal/reference path and tracker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accounts/categories/payees/tags, ordinary transactions/journals, ledger/core reports | Implemented new-stack routes; no redirect to legacy UI | The Streamlit bookkeeping pages and writers are retired; local operator administration remains.  |
| Ordinary transaction receipts | Implemented; default hosted runtime accepts the explicit Drive binding above | Operator grant/folder installation and real-provider verification remain required. Asset acquisition receipts stay on the ordinary acquisition transaction. |
| Mixed-use source receipts | Implemented source-owned browser/API workflow; source-owned upload/link/download/unlink/recovery with protected source baselines | Outside the default alpha; selected grant/folder and hosted verification remain operator work. Generic projections stay read-only and recurring templates do not own receipts. See [workflow ports](IMPORTS_EXPORTS_AND_INTEGRATIONS.md). |
| Recurring schedules and mixed-use sources/projections | Supported operations: create/edit, schedule state changes, explicit reconciliation and source/projection management | Outside the default alpha. Independent copy/conversion is available under recurring conversion and source copying. Durable generation independent of page loads remains platform operations. See [secondary workflows](RECURRING_AND_ASSETS.md). |
| Fixed assets and depreciation | Supported operations: register/detail/edit, schedules, explicit due posting, overrides and retirement | Outside the default alpha. Acquisition transaction owns receipts; generated depreciation has no independent receipt/copy/import action. Additional mixed-use asset behavior is outside this scope. See [secondary workflows](RECURRING_AND_ASSETS.md). |
| Mileage log/filter/CSV/detail and Maps lookup/routing | Manual trip workflow and optional browser/API Maps integration, with explicit review and manual fallback | Configured Maps key restrictions and controlled provider validation remain operator prerequisites; QuickBooks mileage import is available under mileage imports. Mileage bulk actions remain proposed. See [workflow ports](IMPORTS_EXPORTS_AND_INTEGRATIONS.md). |
| Selected-ledger, transactions and journal-postings financial CSV downloads | Implemented; selected complete entries on Transactions and two full financial downloads on `/data` | Outside the default alpha; these existing CSVs do not replace the complete recovery export or an authorized customer portability artifact. See [workflow ports](IMPORTS_EXPORTS_AND_INTEGRATIONS.md). |
| Transaction CSV/QuickBooks imports; ordinary copy/bulk | Implemented, with read-only previews and explicit protected commands | Outside the default alpha; consume the delivering revision’s evidence before live cutover. |
| Category-template import and standalone report downloads | Excluded by the owner's October 11 scope correction | These routes are not planned; these are unimplemented feature ideas, not migration prerequisites. Existing category management and on-screen reports remain supported. |
| Sheets workbook/backup administration and restore | `/data` exposes financial CSVs; no Sheets administration or live-ledger fallback | PostgreSQL persistence and frozen Sheets source contract preserve frozen format-13 internal recovery; platform operations owns operational backup/recovery; complete entity export supplies complete PostgreSQL operator export and external release and customer lifecycle owns customer delivery. |
| Google/profile/local credential administration | Not a commercial browser workflow | identity and tenancy owns native onboarding/authorization; live owner cutover consumes authorized owner bindings. Do not port deployment-password/all-profile access as commercial identity. |

Existing workflow integration includes financial imports/exports, source-owned receipts,
recurring conversion, Maps and mileage imports. The selected owner-use scope requires
the applicable existing workflows before live cutover. The [workflow-port
guide](IMPORTS_EXPORTS_AND_INTEGRATIONS.md) records the delivered behavior; [browser and
API workflows](RUNTIME.md) retains implementation ownership and approved exclusions.
Local implementation and synthetic checks do not establish deployment, real-provider
verification or live-cutover approval.

PostgreSQL bookkeeping uses the supported browser/API surfaces and the existing
cutover authority contract. Retained Sheets tooling supports authorized format-13
source migration, archive recovery and local administration; it does not provide a
bookkeeping runtime. Unavailable workflows remain unavailable until implemented.
Do not route bookkeeping back to stale Sheets to finish an action, dual-write, or
re-enable Sheets after PostgreSQL divergence. Live owner cutover owns private live
execution; synthetic alpha performs no authority activation.

## Streamlit retirement criterion

**Current source boundary:** Streamlit bookkeeping pages, startup/page recurring
generation and obsolete preparation converters are retired. Retained local operator
administration still requires the flag, loopback bind, application password and
reauthentication. Format-13 migration/archive recovery, current PostgreSQL recovery,
Google grants/folders and forward schema history remain supported. This source change
establishes no merge/deployment or commercial release acceptance.


The commercial image already installs the API/PostgreSQL dependencies without
Streamlit; CI verifies HTTP import/schema construction in that image. Retiring
commercial dependence requires every workflow in the selected release/owner
matrix to have a supported browser/API/service path, tested failures/isolation,
configured durable dependencies and documented routing. Unknown required gaps
must stop that release, while explicitly excluded long-tail slices may continue
independently. No hidden session-state or page-load scheduling may remain.

Before disabling an entity's old writers, consume the supported migration,
acceptance/export, authentication and recovery boundaries for its release stage. Before
repository-wide removal of Streamlit, separately inventory all remaining internal
users/workflows, migrate or explicitly retire each, preserve source and recovery
artifacts, and update operator/user documentation and tests. technical-alpha validation
does not authorize package removal, source deletion or a big-bang cutover. The
[capability retirement
evidence](https://github.com/Roklion/Project_Tabula_Rasa/issues/377) records active
callers, owners, eligible cleanup, retained regression contracts and concrete conditions
for deferred removals. It consumes this routing matrix without adding a release or
owner-cutover prerequisite.

## Restricted-alpha support and retirement

Retiring hosted synthetic acceptance does not retire independently supported
development and test paths.
Provider recovery and wider security/operational acceptance remain separate.

| Capability | Current callers and retention condition |
| --- | --- |
| `http/alpha.py`, `alpha_documents.py` | `http/app.py` gates restricted hosted requests; `http/composition.py` loads the synthetic document binding. Retain focused HTTP/native document tests until the affected environments and document consumers have an explicit replacement or retirement decision. |
| `TrustedDevelopmentContext` | Composition supports loopback development and gated hosted synthetic scope; native API/browser fixtures reuse it. Retain development and isolation coverage until a supported replacement or explicit retirement. |
| `tests/postgres/browser_journey.py` and its native/helper tests | Reusable disposable-fixture journey; preserve all native cases and CI partitions. Hosted synthetic orchestration and dispatch are retired. |

The [single-use staging schema bridge](../operations/DEPLOYMENT.md#retired-staging-bridge-0012-to-0014)
has retired separately. Actual multi-profile authority and legacy writer retirement
still require controlled cutover evidence; synthetic handoff supplies no live authority.

## Acceptance record and outstanding evidence

Use this template for each newly selected candidate; it is not a status board. The
accepted technical-alpha result and approved exclusions are recorded in [technical-alpha
validation
evidence](https://github.com/Roklion/Project_Tabula_Rasa/issues/288#issuecomment-6117319756).
Do not carry those results forward as acceptance of a different release or stage.

| Evidence field | Required record for the selected candidate |
| --- | --- |
| Candidate | Reviewed release SHA, current required CI/reviews, immutable image/index/runtime digests and forward schema revision |
| Deployment | Exact approved environment/binding reference, promotion/smoke links and observed version/readiness |
| Drive custody | Independent staging grant and managed folders, protected installation and preflight; private bindings stay private |
| Receipt journey | Authorized upload/attach, exact-byte download, reference-only unlink, retained-file relink and restart persistence |
| Browser coverage | Current-head native CI for every engine/viewport; separate authorized named-user hosted workflow results under hosted rollout |
| Compatible rollback | Prior/candidate compatible image/schema, maintenance window, both smoke links, retained-data observations and candidate hosted checks repeated |
| Manual quality | Tester/date, actual browser/device versions, touch/keyboard, zoom/reflow, focus and the accepted accessibility scope; record exclusions explicitly rather than inventing observations |
| Provider/recovery limits | Actual plan/region/capacity/quota/access, DB/byte protection, observed limitations, accepted gaps and responsible owner |
| Routing | Every required workflow has a verified implementation/selected-runtime path or an explicit approved exclusion with an issue owner |
| Owner handoff | Applicable live owner cutover workflow/auth/recovery scope, operator authorization and evidence references; alpha is not live migration |

For each selected release, collect live-owner, hosted-identity, operational and
External-admission evidence separately. Keep results and pending decisions in the owning
release discussion, including accepted exclusions. Publication, deployment, provider
writes, live cutover and customer admission each retain their explicit authorization
boundary.
