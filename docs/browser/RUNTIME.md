# Commercial web development and deployment

[ADR 0002](../adr/0002-commercial-web-runtime.md) defines the React/FastAPI
stack and same-origin topology. Use [Development](../DEVELOPMENT.md),
[PostgreSQL operations](../database/POSTGRESQL.md) and
[database concurrency](../database/CONCURRENCY.md) alongside this guide.

## Component responsibilities

The [HTTP/browser foundation](FOUNDATION.md) owns endpoints, request context,
safe errors and shared query/form primitives. [Deployment](../operations/DEPLOYMENT.md)
owns image promotion, schema steps and rollback. [Protected browser mutations](CONCURRENCY.md)
carry loaded baselines into service-owned writes. [Identity](../identity/AUTHENTICATION.md)
owns named sessions and current membership; [release validation](RELEASE_VALIDATION.md)
defines the selected staging scope.

Owner-operated use composes the same runtime with explicit accepted-profile
bindings and [cutover controls](../accounting/CUTOVER.md). Database branch names
and an HTTP production mode do not establish commercial activation. The internal
Streamlit/Sheets composition remains separately available during transition.

## Package and build ownership

Keep one repository, the existing Python package and existing Alembic chain.
Do not move neutral services into the HTTP package or introduce an ORM mirror.
The package ownership is:

```text
tabula_rasa/
  application/                  existing neutral services/contracts/domain seams
  infrastructure/postgres/      existing SQL adapters, database lifecycle, migrations

    app.py                      create_app factory, lifespan, route assembly
    composition.py              database + authorized entity/document service binding
    context.py                  server-authorized identity context resolver

  src/api/                      typed client + query keys/mutation wrappers
  src/app/                      routing/context and responsive shell
  src/components/               shared accessible controls/form states
  src/features/                 independently delivered bookkeeping slices
  src/styles/                   design tokens and common layout rules
  dist/                         ignored build output
contracts/http/openapi.json      generated, committed transport schema
requirements-api.txt             API + audited non-UI Python dependencies
deploy/commercial/Dockerfile      multi-stage Node-build/Python-runtime image
deploy/commercial/render.yaml     Render environment/resource declaration
tests/http/                      HTTP transport and real-PostgreSQL integration
web/src/**/*.test.tsx             Vitest/React Testing Library tests
web/e2e/                         shell and supported browser workflow checks
```

Use root Python imports for `tabula_rasa` in local commands, tests and images. Do not
create a second Python distribution or npm workspace manager for one browser package.
`requirements-api.txt` pins the API runtime and required shared dependencies without
importing/installing Streamlit as an API runtime requirement. Install it together with
`requirements-postgres.txt` in the image; extend the development dependency file for API
tests. receipt workflows adds document-provider dependencies when its adapter is
selected, without making Drive part of HTTP models. Commit library locks/pins; never
commit generated build output or environment secrets.

Required npm scripts from browser foundation: `dev`, `build` (TypeScript check + Vite
build), `typecheck`, `lint`, `test` (Vitest run), `test:e2e` (run-once contracts then
Playwright UI), `test:contracts` (HTTP/Git), `test:browser` (all UI projects or an
explicit shard), and `api:generate` (`openapi-typescript` over
`../contracts/http/openapi.json`). The API exporter from HTTP foundation writes
deterministic JSON to `--output` without reading settings/credentials, starting database
lifespan or using the network. CI runs export then generation, rejects changes to
committed generated files, and compiles the consumer; no schema fetch from a running
staging service.

## Local topology and commands

Use Python 3.12 and Node.js 24 LTS with npm. From the repository root, the
**existing, runnable** database setup is:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
docker compose -f compose.postgres.yml up -d --wait
$env:TABULA_RASA_DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql+psycopg://tabula_dev@127.0.0.1:55432/tabula_dev'
python -m tabula_rasa.infrastructure.postgres upgrade
python -m tabula_rasa.infrastructure.postgres health
```

This is a synthetic, disposable loopback database. Native pytest integration
requires the separate `TABULA_RASA_TEST_DATABASE_URL` process variable pointing
to a disposable administrator endpoint; never infer it from the runtime URL or
point tests at retained staging/production. Migration/operator details stay in
[PostgreSQL operations](../database/POSTGRESQL.md#local-setup).

Install/export/generate the implemented foundations once from root:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements-api.txt -r requirements-postgres.txt
python -m tabula_rasa.http.export_openapi --output contracts/http/openapi.json
npm --prefix web ci
npm --prefix web run api:generate
```

Run the API and Vite in separate terminals. Each terminal starts at repository
root. API terminal (activate `.venv` first):

```powershell
$env:TABULA_RASA_ENVIRONMENT = 'development'
$env:TABULA_RASA_PUBLIC_ORIGIN = 'http://127.0.0.1:5173'
$env:TABULA_RASA_DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql+psycopg://tabula_dev@127.0.0.1:55432/tabula_dev'
$env:TABULA_RASA_TRUSTED_ENTITY_ID = 'alpha-synthetic'
python -m tabula_rasa.http.seed_development  # Once, on the blank synthetic development DB.
python -m uvicorn tabula_rasa.http.app:create_app --factory --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload --no-access-log
```

Browser terminal:

```powershell
npm --prefix web run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173 --strictPort
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. Vite must proxy `/api` (without stripping the prefix)
to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`; the browser uses relative URLs and has one origin.
Use `127.0.0.1` consistently, rather than mixing it with `localhost` for cookies.
PostgreSQL remains on `127.0.0.1:55432`. Bind all local listeners to loopback.
Health checks can be called directly on API port 8000. Root production routes
serve `/health/live`, `/health/ready` and `/version`; they are not SPA paths.

The default trusted ID is the explicitly seeded `alpha-synthetic` entity; the seed also
creates `beta-synthetic` so the local business selector can exercise independent
contexts. Both are fixed demonstration fixtures, not arbitrary Browser-selected
entities. [Core workflows](BOOKKEEPING.md) describes the selection and bookkeeping
paths. The seed command uses the existing entity repository, refuses
hosted/non-development targets, and stops if that ID exists. Other IDs or an unseeded
fixture fail startup. No seeding, recurring generation or schema migration occurs on
ordinary application startup. Before identity and tenancy, no local environment variable
stands in for commercial membership.

For schema/client checks:

```powershell
python -m tabula_rasa.http.export_openapi --output contracts/http/openapi.json
npm --prefix web run api:generate
git diff --exit-code -- contracts/http/openapi.json web/src/api/schema.d.ts
npm --prefix web run build
npm --prefix web run lint
npm --prefix web test
```

API tests call the service boundary with fakes and native PostgreSQL; browser tests
cover visible loading/validation/conflict and entity-cache isolation. Protected browser
mutations adds the two-loaded-client stale edit/delete and missing-baseline scenarios
against real PostgreSQL. Run affected tests and fast lint/type/style checks before
publishing or pushing review fixes. Repository CI runs the full suite concurrently with
review; its current-revision `Full test suite` check must succeed before review-loop
completion. A full local run is exceptional diagnostic work, not a publication or
terminal-review prerequisite. See
[Development](../DEVELOPMENT.md#authoritative-ci-and-required-check).

## Hosted environment contract

| Environment | Runtime/data | Exposure and release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | Vite + loopback Uvicorn + existing Docker PostgreSQL 18 | Synthetic fixture context; developer starts each process. |
| Hosted development | Own Render image service + scoped Neon environment/roles | Synthetic data; validated `main` deploys; explicit restricted alpha or named mode. Record selected plan limitations. |
| Retained staging | Separate Render image service + retained Neon environment/roles | Explicit commit/image promotion and access mode; synthetic acceptance data; named-provider transition follows hosted identity rollout. This is the real persistent staging target, not local Compose or a per-test DB. |
| Intended production | Separate Render service + distinct Neon production branch/endpoint and scoped runtime/migration access | Promote the staging-tested image digest only after identity, cutover and operations/recovery gates. Reject trusted alpha context. |

For the current pre-activation stage, the operator has selected Neon Free with
production and retained UAT on distinct branches/endpoints in one project; [ADR
0002](../adr/0002-commercial-web-runtime.md#deployment-decision) records this amendment.
Keep configuration and access scoped to each environment, preserve the retained UAT
database, and use separate isolated recovery targets. A shared project shares
administration and capacity; branch separation does not prove independent project
access. Formal commercial activation still requires the isolation/protection/objective
review under PostgreSQL persistence, authority cutover and platform operations described
in [PostgreSQL recovery](../operations/DATABASE_RECOVERY.md). deployment, browser and
API workflows and application transition now permit suitable free tiers for technical
dev/staging; record capacity and idle-suspension limits at the [manual
checkpoint](../operations/DEPLOYMENT.md#manual-operator-checkpoint). This does not
authorize provisioning, cloning or commercial activation.

GitHub Actions builds the `linux/amd64` image into GHCR; Render image-backed
services (`runtime: image`) consume its immutable digest. CI explicitly triggers
hosted dev after checks; image-backed services do not follow Git pushes on their
own. Render terminates HTTPS and forwards to one Uvicorn port. The image contains
the compiled browser assets and the API, with no Node process. Use one canonical
origin per environment; redirect additional hosts rather than sharing session
cookies across environments. HTTP and static routing/cache policy is owned by
[ADR 0002](../adr/0002-commercial-web-runtime.md#deployment-decision).

Neon runtime connections use direct/unpooled TLS URLs with `sslmode=require`,
small SQLAlchemy pools and the existing bounded configuration. Keep the runtime
role free of schema-administration permissions. Environment projects are not
tenant boundaries: authorized membership/entity context still scopes every
bookkeeping operation within a project's database. Do not provision one DB per
client-supplied profile key.

## Configuration and secrets boundary

The HTTP environment/public-origin/release/trusted-entity settings below are implemented
by HTTP foundation and read from process environment only. deployment implements the
alpha gate and deployment settings; identity and tenancy still owns commercial
identity/session settings. They do not alter Streamlit settings.

| Setting | Owner and visibility |
| --- | --- |
| `TABULA_RASA_ENVIRONMENT` | Server; `development`, `staging` or `production`. Trusted fixture mode explicitly prohibited in production. |
| `TABULA_RASA_ACCESS_MODE` | Server and matching deployment environment variable; explicit `restricted_alpha` or `named_user` on hosted services. Only named mode permits owner/external use. |
| `TABULA_RASA_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` | Server; exact canonical browser origin for Host/Origin/cookie policy; no wildcard. |
| `TABULA_RASA_RELEASE_ID` | Build/deploy metadata; Git SHA or immutable release ID, safe in `/version` and logs. Image digest/schema head recorded with the release. |
| `PORT` | Hosting process; Uvicorn binds the assigned container port. Local command explicitly selects 8000. |
| `TABULA_RASA_DATABASE_URL` and existing pool/timeout settings | Server runtime secrets/config; current `DatabaseSettings` owns validation. URL never enters the browser, image layer, logs, error text or OpenAPI. |
| `TABULA_RASA_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` | Deployment job secret only; job maps it to `TABULA_RASA_DATABASE_URL` for the existing CLI. Never injected into the running app. |
| `TABULA_RASA_DEPLOY_DATABASE_SHA256` | Explicit selected Neon endpoint binding, checked by both runtime and migration processes. |
| `TABULA_RASA_TEST_DATABASE_URL` | Explicit test process only; disposable native test administrator endpoint. |
| `TABULA_RASA_TRUSTED_ENTITY_ID` | Local/test synthetic context, or fixed hosted synthetic alpha scope behind the deployment gate. Never accepted from a request; absent in production. |
| `TABULA_RASA_ALPHA_USERNAME` / `TABULA_RASA_ALPHA_PASSWORD_HASH` | Temporary deployment server gate secrets; distinct per hosted non-production environment, never browser build values or commercial roles. |
| Identity/session/OAuth secrets | identity and tenancy server secret injection and authorized credential-store binding. Provider-specific names/schema belong to identity and tenancy, not frontend config. |

The browser has no environment-specific API URL or secrets. Relative API routing
lets the same compiled artifact promote from staging to production. `VITE_*`
values are public build constants; allow only reviewed non-sensitive values such
as build identity, and never copy server environment files into the web build.
Do not introduce frontend environment overrides for entity authorization.

Local `.env.local` remains ignored and is loaded by the existing database settings only.
Export HTTP settings explicitly in the process; its loader does not read an environment
file. Hosted processes receive secrets from the environment's provider secret store;
image builds and schema export have none. Existing `.streamlit` files/password/Google
grants stay with the internal edition. Commercial per-customer connections are resolved
from authorized context under identity and tenancy; no fallback to a legacy profile's
grant or Drive root.

## Deployment lifecycle and manual checkpoint

Before provisioning, the operator supplies Render account/project access,
selected stage-appropriate service capacity, GHCR image access, Neon projects/roles,
approved geographically close US regions with PostgreSQL 18, DNS/TLS ownership,
and environment-specific secrets/deploy credentials. Verify provider support, budgets/limits and retained
staging connectivity. These are explicit manual tasks, not completed resources.
The exact setup and hosted evidence checklist lives in [Technical deployment](../operations/DEPLOYMENT.md).
An agent must stop at this checkpoint if credentials/provisioning are missing;
do not substitute SQLite, temporary memory, another provider or production data.

Deployment implements a reproducible multi-stage image build and explicit promotion:

1. Run required Python/native-PostgreSQL and implemented web/API checks; export
   and verify schema/client drift. Build the image without runtime secrets and
   identify it by commit and immutable digest. Retain rollback digests in GHCR.
   For schema changes, first deploy a tested bridge image declaring both old and
   target schema revisions compatible; otherwise plan explicit maintenance and
   drain. Initially API readiness accepts only the current head. Compatibility
   is declared by tested code, never an operator wildcard/bypass setting.
2. In a serialized environment deployment job with the **migration** credential,
   inspect `current`, apply `upgrade`, then run `health` using the existing CLI.
   Schema changes must remain compatible with the still-running old image.
3. Deploy the image to Render with the **runtime** credential. Require
   `/health/ready` before traffic/promotion; a failed migration or readiness
   step stops the release. Application startup never migrates.
4. Verify version, deep-link/static/API routing, browser -> API -> real
   PostgreSQL synthetic smoke and access restrictions. A post-deploy smoke
   failure stops further promotion. Restricted alpha redeploys the prior compatible
   digest; named mode stops for reviewed operator recovery without automatic rollback.
   Promote the same image only after staging acceptance evidence is recorded.
5. If application code fails, redeploy the prior schema-compatible digest after
   verifying named-auth/configuration compatibility where applicable.
   Incompatible schema failures stop for the operator; no automatic downgrade,
   restore or accounting-data deletion. Recovery is managed database recovery and platform operations.

The implemented temporary alpha HTTP Basic gate covers shell, data, document and schema
routes over TLS. Minimal health probes are exempt for the platform; unsafe requests
still require Origin/CSRF protection. A trusted fixture ID without the gate must make
hosted startup fail closed. identity and tenancy's implemented named path replaces both
the gate and fixture resolver before owner/external use. Follow [authenticated
rollout](../identity/HOSTED_ROLLOUT.md) for manual configuration and the named rollback
procedure. [hosted identity rollout](../identity/HOSTED_ROLLOUT.md) records current
hosted results and outstanding acceptance. deployment records the precise proxy
boundary: Uvicorn trusts no forwarded headers; configured Host and Origin remain
authoritative. Spoofed forwarding/Host inputs are covered by tests.

Retain staging across releases and coordinate its separate migration rehearsal with [the
persistent staging
checkpoint](../accounting/SHEETS_MIGRATION.md#persistent-staging-checkpoint). The Sheets
migration framework framework drill already passed on the operator-selected Neon UAT
environment on 2026-10-06; deployment must verify authorized reuse of a compatible
retained target or provision a separate commercial staging target. That drill does not
substitute for realistic source reconciliation, whole-profile acceptance or the
browser/API staging smoke. Migrated-profile HTTP composition must reuse [authority
cutover's trusted authority/document binding](../accounting/CUTOVER.md) through
`create_application`, rather than bypassing it with the low-level PostgreSQL factory. Do
not overwrite an existing operator UAT target, stamp a retained old schema, or claim
that a local UUID integration database satisfies this gate. Selection of this stack does
not activate entities or complete migration, exports, recovery/PITR, commercial auth,
beta or Streamlit retirement requirements.

## Browser quality and alpha gate

[Commercial browser quality](TESTING.md) owns browser testing's repeatable
Playwright/axe gate, viewport/engine matrix, synthetic fixture cleanup and the
release-evidence boundaries. Candidate-specific results and remaining work live in
[hosted identity rollout](../identity/HOSTED_ROLLOUT.md), [external-beta
acceptance](RELEASE_VALIDATION.md) and the applicable workflow owner issues; completed
technical-alpha evidence remains in technical-alpha validation.
