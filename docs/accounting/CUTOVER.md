# Bookkeeping acceptance and controlled cutover

This guide controls whole-profile acceptance, maintenance, authority activation
and rollback for the shared browser/API runtime. It extends
[migration loaders](SHEETS_MIGRATION.md), the
[frozen format-13 source](../SHEETS_SOURCE_CONTRACT.md) and
[complete entity export](EXPORT.md).

[Existing entity claims](../identity/CONNECTIONS_AND_CLAIMS.md) map named ownership
without reimporting books; live execution and authority activation still require
explicit approval. Streamlit remains the internal Sheets edition and has no
backend picker.

## Reuse and ownership

- Existing extraction/shared validators own the source boundary. The core and
  secondary loaders own deterministic complete units, mappings and restart.
- Existing repository projections and reporting calculations own accounting
  meaning; acceptance extends their reconciliation rather than creating another
  calculation engine. The export adapter can read that same target snapshot.
- New logic records whole-profile acceptance, operator gate references, one
  entity's authority, and its first committed PostgreSQL bookkeeping mutation.
- The only new document adapter translates entity IDs to existing profile keys;
  the selected profile's provider grant/folder, retries and byte handling retain
  their existing owner. No byte migration or parallel write engine is added.

## Whole-profile acceptance

Pause source edits, recurring/depreciation jobs, imports and receipt operations.
Drain all request/worker processes capable of writing that profile. Preserve the
source and keep this maintenance window in effect through final smoke checks.
Sheets has no cross-worksheet snapshot isolation: operator-enforced source
freezing is part of the procedure, not a capability inferred from an API read.

After dry-run and a complete final load, run one acceptance command:

```powershell
python scripts/migrate_sheets_to_postgres.py --profile alpha --entity entity-alpha --accept
python scripts/migrate_sheets_to_postgres.py --profile alpha --entity entity-alpha --accept --format text
```

JSON is the default machine-readable report; `text` groups human-readable differences by
domain and opaque stable record key. Either command returns nonzero on any difference.
`--load --accept` explicitly combines complete load with acceptance. `--accept` alone is
read-only and does not activate a backend or change migration run status. A successful
source extraction goes through Sheets migration framework's actual read-only shared
format-13 header and domain validators. Earlier, additional or otherwise unsupported
populated source formats fail before any source/target writes; there is no historical
conversion path.

The report records frozen Sheets source contract/PR #263 and its delivered commit as
source-contract evidence. It verifies every supported source-owned unit and loaded
checkpoint, stable/mapped identities and original update provenance; reference
hierarchies and opening balances; exact Decimal postings; complete journals; recurring
and mixed-use owners/occurrences/projections; assets, overrides and posted history;
mileage/tags; referenced and unreferenced document metadata and exact links; and
existing financial reports for all activity and each activity month. Complete canonical
export generation and independent format/relationship validation occur on the same
coherent read-only REPEATABLE READ target snapshot. All 26 supported bookkeeping
collections must be representable. Valid additional target records/relationships are
differences even if the export itself is valid. Incomplete checkpoints or matching core
totals cannot produce final acceptance.

Every difference blocks acceptance; this version has no implicit tolerances or
waivers. Explicit normalization is limited to existing domain Decimal rules,
UTC creation instants, tag sets, existing ordered receipt/line relationships,
target-owned mutation timestamps (original instants are retained in mappings),
the documented epoch for unavailable creation instants, deterministic namespace
collision/document mappings, and unavailable historical import attribution.
No generated ledger history or absent facts are invented. Document bytes stay
in the existing DocumentStore. See the migration guide for their exact mapping.

Reports contain counts, fixed check/field names, versions and opaque digests,
never private financial values, descriptions, names, provider locators, source
record IDs or credentials. Keep the actual full export private and outside Git:
use `scripts/export_postgres_entity.py --output <private-path> --entity entity-alpha`
and its offline `--validate` mode. An in-memory export verification is included
in acceptance; the operator retains the delivered artifact for sign-off.

## Backend configuration and maintenance

Trusted server configuration uses an independent `bookkeeping_backends` table
keyed by the existing configuration profile. This is preserved when local JSON
profiles are merged into app secrets. Do not put authority settings into the
editable local profile store or accept them from a browser request. Example:

```toml
[bookkeeping_backends.alpha]
backend = "maintenance"

[bookkeeping_backends.beta]
backend = "sheets"
```

`create_application(profile_key, secrets, database=...)` requires an explicit
entry and composes exactly one backend. `maintenance` refuses composition;
`sheets` reuses existing Sheets composition. `postgres` requires the activated
entity, environment, database identity and accepted document-folder binding:

```toml
[bookkeeping_backends.alpha]
backend = "postgres"
entity_id = "entity-alpha"
mode = "rehearsal"
```

The caller supplies the pool from approved server database settings and owns its
lifecycle. Merely configuring a database URL never activates PostgreSQL. No
ordinary request loads data, changes authority, migrates schema or dual-writes.
There is no fallback to Sheets when PostgreSQL is unavailable. Service context
uses the canonical entity ID; the document adapter continues using the original
profile key for Google OAuth, receipt appProperties, inventory and provider
caches. Existing files are not retagged or moved.

The legacy `create_sheets_application` still defaults to Sheets for existing internal
profiles without an authority entry, and refuses a configured maintenance/PostgreSQL
profile before workbook initialization. Existing cached Sheets graphs do not consult
PostgreSQL on each Google write: stop/drain those processes and jobs before final
extraction and restart them with the new trusted configuration. Backend selection is an
operational composition decision, not tenant authentication or membership. identity and
tenancy owns commercial authorization.

## Activation evidence and operator decision points

For every migrated entity, retain:

| Gate | Required evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Frozen source | Supported format-13 source with accepted freeze/retirement metadata and a recorded source snapshot; acceptance records the provenance automatically. |
| Schema baseline | Shared-validator source preflight and the supported immutable schema baseline; the target uses its validated forward chain. |
| Whole-profile acceptance | Fresh whole-profile acceptance of the exact source/entity/run, every unit and relationship, with no differences. |
| Complete entity export | Verified complete target export, its content digest and privately delivered artifact. |
| Maintenance | Source edit/jobs pause, drained old writers, preserved source/folder, intended target and rollback decision recorded by the operator. |

Commercial production additionally requires **completed mutation baseline contract
commercial caller baseline/transaction/integrity verification**, successful **managed
database recovery actual managed backup restore and requested-point PITR**, and the
operator's production setup record. The [managed recovery
runbook](../operations/DATABASE_RECOVERY.md) owns managed database recovery's
objectives, effective-settings inspection, both real recovery milestones and the private
evidence handoff. A repository test alone does not establish those operational
milestones. The setup record must identify the provisioned, reachable intended
production database, its approved secret configuration, schema decision/revision chain,
managed backup/PITR effective settings, agreed/observed RPO/RTO, isolated restore
strategy and separate staging database. Stop before preparation/activation and request
operator setup if any prerequisite is absent. Staging rehearsal and lasting owner
operation use the non-commercial `rehearsal` evidence policy; neither satisfies the
commercial gates or can be composed as `commercial_production`. See the owner-operated
production procedure below.

Prepare an evidence JSON outside Git. Values are reviewed repository issue/PR
links (optionally with a comment anchor) or `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>` references
to retained private operator evidence. They are attestations by the authorized
operator, not automatic verification of a GitHub issue's status. Arbitrary free
text, credentials and private data are rejected from this record. Rehearsal
requires exactly `source_freeze` and `schema_baseline`. Production requires those
plus `production_setup`, `transaction_integrity`, `backup_restore` and
`point_in_time_recovery`. Each reference must point to completed evidence,
including the prerequisites above; do not substitute a ticket's existence.

Apply forward revision `0005_bookkeeping_cutover` explicitly with the normal
PostgreSQL operator tool. The retained `0001_initial`/`0004_mileage_order`
revisions remain unchanged. The new table stores control-plane authority and
gate references, outside the 26-collection portable bookkeeping format v1.

```powershell
python scripts/cutover_bookkeeping.py inspect --profile alpha --entity entity-alpha
python scripts/cutover_bookkeeping.py prepare --profile alpha --entity entity-alpha --mode rehearsal --evidence <private-evidence.json>
python scripts/cutover_bookkeeping.py activate --profile alpha --entity entity-alpha
```

`prepare` reruns whole-profile acceptance against fresh extracted source data,
marks its matching run `validated`, verifies the complete export again after
that metadata change, and atomically records `prepared` with the accepted export
digest. A prepared target rejects bookkeeping mutations. A matching preparation
can be repeated; another source/run/profile cannot take over its evidence.
Failure before preparation leaves Sheets authoritative and changes no target
authority/status. `activate` requires that prepared export remain unchanged.

For production use `--mode commercial_production` during preparation. Inspect
both intended production and separate staging endpoints through their approved
configuration, then supply `--production-database-sha256` and
`--staging-database-sha256` to activation. The production identity must match
the actual supplied pool and differ from the staging identity; both identities
are recorded. Fingerprints exclude usernames, passwords and connection options.
This checks the declared target binding; the operator still owns the truthful
environment/setup attestation. `inspect` reports current authority and rollback
availability, allowing a safe read after an uncertain command response.

After activation, deploy the PostgreSQL backend entry, restart into the new
composition, and run:

```powershell
python scripts/cutover_bookkeeping.py smoke --profile alpha --entity entity-alpha
```

Keep all writes/jobs paused for this check. It exercises actual application
reference, ledger, journal, asset, recurring, mixed-use, mileage, receipt and
reporting reads, then repeats whole-profile accounting and complete export
verification. Retain its safe report and private export. Only after passing
smoke checks release maintenance for the selected environment. Mark/archive
the prior workbook as the preserved pre-cutover source, restrict its editing
and keep its jobs disabled; retain the workbook, receipt folder and backups.
This tooling never deletes or rewrites the source, moves receipt bytes, changes
sharing or starts a scheduler. The operator performs that archival control.

## Rollback and subsequent recovery

Before any committed PostgreSQL bookkeeping mutation, re-extract the preserved
format-13 source and explicitly roll back:

```powershell
python scripts/cutover_bookkeeping.py rollback --profile alpha --entity entity-alpha
```

The source must match the accepted snapshot/run, and the complete target export
must still match its accepted digest. Stop/drain PostgreSQL processes, change
trusted configuration back to `sheets`, restart the Sheets edition and resume
source jobs only after this command records `sheets`. The PostgreSQL target is
retained for inspection and its cached services cannot commit bookkeeping
writes. A prepared target can use the same rollback procedure if activation is
abandoned. No reverse migration or deletion occurs.

Native entity-scoped triggers guard every canonical bookkeeping table. Their authority
lock serializes mutations with preparation/activation/rollback. The first **committed**
insert/update/delete while active marks `divergent` in the same transaction; a
rolled-back mutation does not. Secondary/document/reference writes count even if P&L
totals are unchanged. The marker stays set even if an edit is later reversed. Other
entities do not affect this profile's marker. Once set, Sheets rollback is refused:
recover PostgreSQL through managed database recovery and platform operations's tested
backup/PITR procedure and coordinated DocumentStore recovery. An old Sheets source is
then a historical recovery artifact, never a live fallback. Database administrator
operations, trigger disabling and direct manual source edits remain outside ordinary
application guarantees and this cutover procedure.

## Owner-operated production procedure

Use the same production browser/API application, PostgreSQL repositories,
accounting services, authorization and deployment process. Only the activation
evidence/recovery agreement is non-commercial. The database branch name
`production` and HTTP `environment="production"` do not select commercial
cutover evidence. Keep the trusted backend entry's **stored** `mode="rehearsal"`:
this existing value has no timeout, automatic reset, read-only restriction or
requirement that the database be disposable. Its `postgres` authority is durable
and continues after committed bookkeeping writes and process/pool restart.
This procedure gives that existing non-commercial behavior a named lasting-use
contract without altering deployed revision `0005_bookkeeping_cutover`.

Rehearsal means a controlled practice execution; owner-operated production means the
owner's lasting live ledger with explicitly accepted recovery limitations. External beta
adds identity and tenancy and external release and customer lifecycle's user/tenant and
stage protection requirements. Commercial activation additionally uses
`commercial_production` and commercial recovery agreement's completed evidence. An owner
acceptance is never commercial certification.

Before an actual live execution, the authorized operator must:

1. Retain a private owner decision identifying the exact profile, source
   workbook, target entity, intended database fingerprint, document grant/folder,
   runtime release, authorized access, recovery owner and accepted limitations.
   Inspect the intended endpoint using `inspect` through approved configuration;
   do not infer it from a branch name or use UAT as the live target. The existing
   activation records the actual endpoint fingerprint and composition checks it
   on every new service graph. Verify schema/connectivity/TLS with the existing
   PostgreSQL operator tools; keep credentials and evidence contents private.
2. State which recovery protections are actually available now, their measured
   limits and document-byte recovery ownership. NAS protection planned in
   [NAS backup and restore](../operations/NAS_BACKUP.md) stays marked
   pending until scheduling, archive protection/health and isolated restore pass.
   Logical archives recover captured points, not continuous PITR. If working
   NAS recovery is required before live writes, make NAS backup and restore a deployment
   prerequisite. It is not a prerequisite for owner-operated runtime's technical completion.
   A subscription, commercial RPO/RTO agreement and alternate-operator commercial
   handoff are not conditions for this owner contract. Explicitly accept current
   limitations; do not fabricate commercial evidence to unlock use.
3. Follow the same source freeze/writer drain, supported format-13 extraction,
   complete load, fresh zero-difference whole-profile acceptance and private
   26-collection export procedure above. Preserve the source, receipt bytes and
   backups. Prepare with `--mode rehearsal` and exactly the existing
   `source_freeze`/`schema_baseline` references. Retain the broader private owner
   decision separately; the two-field evidence JSON is not a recovery guarantee.
4. Activate, deploy the explicit PostgreSQL backend configuration and restart
   the shared runtime with the approved database and authenticated resolver.
   Run the existing cutover `smoke` before releasing maintenance. A missing
   target, inactive authority, different mode, profile/source, endpoint or
   document folder must stop startup/use rather than fall back to Sheets.
5. With separate authorization for a controlled live bookkeeping operation,
   verify a legitimate committed write, restart, and verify its persisted result,
   reports and complete export. Inspect `divergent` and the rollback boundary.
   After divergence, the frozen-source acceptance/smoke comparison is expected
   to differ: use ordinary runtime health, report and export checks rather than
   reloading/reaccepting the old source. Sheets remains archived; recovery uses
   the available PostgreSQL protection and coordinated document recovery.

### Shared production runtime composition

The deployed app factory uses `create_app` and its existing `runtime_factory`
seam. Bind migrated entities using `open_migrated_runtime`. Production and
named-user mode require the configured `NamedIdentity` session/membership
resolver, with the same environment and database target as the ledger. Startup
rejects a different control-plane target before binding profile credentials.
Follow the [authorization contract](../identity/AUTHORIZATION.md); a custom lambda
returning a plausible context is not a production authentication mechanism.

```python
from functools import partial
from tabula_rasa.http.app import create_app
from tabula_rasa.http.composition import open_migrated_runtime

# These are supplied by normal server deployment/identity configuration.

# NamedIdentity validates durable sessions and current membership/selection.

def build_app(authenticated_resolver, entity_profiles, profile_secrets):
    return create_app(runtime_factory=partial(
        open_migrated_runtime,
        resolve_context=authenticated_resolver,
        entity_profiles=entity_profiles,
        profile_secrets=profile_secrets,
    ))
```

The server-only mapping explicitly associates canonical entity IDs with source
profile keys. Database settings use the existing approved loader (or an explicit
`DatabaseSettings` supplied by the deployment). Startup owns one pool, checks
all configured authority/document bindings and current schema readiness, and
closes the pool on failure/shutdown. Requests compose fresh scoped services
through `MigratedProfileServices` and `create_application`. All normal
identity, capability, entity, Host, Origin and CSRF checks remain in force.
The factory refuses arbitrary production resolvers and the synthetic fixture option; migrated service binding also
refuses a `trusted_development` context. Setting `rehearsal` or a database URL
does not authenticate anyone. No new login, owner authorization bypass,
domain engine, source loader, scheduler or recovery state machine is introduced.

The resolver and deployment integration must be real and approved before using private
data. identity and tenancy owns normal web identity/session delivery; deployment owns
hosted deployment. Core/secondary workflows and existing-functionality ports are
implemented; [Live owner execution record](https://github.com/Roklion/Project_Tabula_Rasa/issues/303) records their selected-release
verification and owner decisions. Code completion alone does not establish that the
approved deployment has working authentication, document bindings and every required
workflow. Stop before live migration until that evidence is accepted. This is a
setup/coverage checkpoint, not a second owner app.

### Reuse and completion evidence

Inspected/reused: `composition.py` owns authority/profile/document binding;
the cutover controller/CLI and revision 0005 own acceptance and durable authority;
native guards own divergence; `http/app.py`, `PostgresRuntime`, request context
and `MigratedProfileServices` own shared HTTP lifecycle/authorization; existing
repositories and export/report services own bookkeeping reads/writes. The new
factory extends that existing composition with startup validation. No parallel
domain logic or schema/mode extension is needed.

`tests/postgres/test_owner_operated_cutover.py` exercises the actual shared
production HTTP app and native PostgreSQL with two synthetic migrated profiles,
two pool/application lifetimes, account/financial writes, report/export reads,
document ownership, invalid target/authority and request-guard failures, and
post-divergence rollback refusal. Its resolver is an explicitly synthetic test
stand-in; this does not certify deployed authentication or a private migration.
Existing tests retain commercial evidence refusal and complete acceptance gates.
Run these affected checks against an explicit disposable test endpoint:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/http tests/test_backend_composition.py tests/postgres/test_owner_operated_cutover.py tests/postgres/test_cutover.py tests/postgres/test_migration_acceptance.py
```

Implementation and reviewed synthetic verification are recorded in [Owner-runtime implementation evidence](https://github.com/Roklion/Project_Tabula_Rasa/issues/299) and [PR
#302](https://github.com/Roklion/Project_Tabula_Rasa/pull/302). Those results establish
the supported runtime path, not a private/live operation.

## Execution verification and evidence

For live owner execution, verify the selected-release
access/bindings/workflow checks, operator authorization and accepted recovery limits,
source freeze/writer drain, actual load/acceptance/export, authority activation,
post-write restart/report/export/isolation and final owner acceptance. Keep pending
manual-versus-automatic generation and depreciation scope decisions there. This guide
defines the procedure, not their live status.

[NAS backup and restore](../operations/NAS_BACKUP.md) owns independent NAS
enablement/restore; [receipt byte recovery](../storage/RECEIPT_RECOVERY.md) records
receipt-byte recovery; [operational readiness
verification](../operations/AUDIT_RECOVERY.md) collects stage-specific capacity/recovery
evidence. [commercial recovery agreement](../operations/DATABASE_RECOVERY.md) retains
commercial recovery/activation acceptance. No old local test count, synthetic rehearsal
or closed implementation issue supplies those decisions.
