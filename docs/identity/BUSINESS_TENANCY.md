# Business tenancy and forward rollout

Each business has its own private backing organization. A user can be Owner of
one business, Admin of another and Read-only in a third. Membership versions,
invitations and last-active-owner protection apply independently to each
business. My Businesses is a derived authorized list, not a tenant record.

The previous interface grouped businesses under a selected workspace and implied
one shared role. Current business-first navigation is flat: the same verified
identity can select A as Owner and B as Admin or Read-only. Member/invitation APIs
take a business ID and resolve its private container server-side. The compatibility
organization APIs remain deprecated; they do not authorize another business.
No table deletion, identity/session rewrite or automatic grant conversion follows
the presentation change.

The retained `organization_entities` mapping (not a new ledger table) associates
the immutable canonical `business_entities.id` with its authorization container.
Revision `0016_business_tenancy` adds `UNIQUE (organization_id)` alongside the
existing entity primary key, composite foreign keys and ownership-update guard.
Inactive bindings also occupy their container. Empty organizations remain valid
for explicitly approved historical claims; they grant no business access.

## Creation and authorization

The existing bootstrap transaction creates a new organization, only the acting
user's Owner membership, one canonical business, standard ledger defaults and
the durable actor/request receipt. It never copies another business's members.
The compatibility `POST /api/v1/workspaces/bootstrap` retains its existing
request/result contract. New calls to
`POST /api/v1/workspaces/{organization_id}/businesses` are forbidden, including
Owner and concurrent calls. An exact authorized historical receipt may still
be replayed; replay creates no rows. Business-first presentation and thin
business-only transport adapters build on this same bootstrap owner.

Ledger, privileged import/export/recovery and receipt operations retain their
explicit entity guards and server-resolved membership. Compatibility member
and invitation routes resolve the supplied container through its unique active
business and current membership. A client organization ID/name never grants
authority. Ambiguous containers fail closed even on the prior schema. A role
change or removal in A changes only A's authorization version; B's role,
membership, selected scope and provider binding remain independent.

Legacy claim previews reject a container occupied by any other entity, just as
apply does. The database constraint also protects direct SQL and races between
claims, bindings and bootstrap. Approved claim hashes, document/grant scopes,
membership freshness, recipient verification, sole-owner succession and
server-side Origin/CSRF/session checks retain their existing owners.

## Read-only inventory

Against the exact intended database, using approved secret injection:

```powershell
python -m scripts.inspect_business_tenancy
```

This opens one read-only snapshot and returns database fingerprint, schema
revision, counts of containers/bindings, memberships, invitations, bootstrap
receipts, claims, provider connections, sessions and support grants, plus empty
and multi-business container counts. Exit 0 means no conflicting mappings, 2
means reconciliation is required, and 1 means preflight was unavailable.
Readiness is a structural observation, not migration approval. Repeat it after
any approved changes and compare the exact database fingerprint. It emits no
names, emails, subjects, token hashes, provider references or bookkeeping data.

An operator must inspect detailed mappings only in approved private custody.
Inventory **all states**, not just active rows:

| Existing owner | Required private inventory and decision |
| --- | --- |
| `organization_entities`, `organizations` | Each immutable entity/container ID and state; identify every container with more than one retained binding. |
| `memberships`, `identity_users`, `identity_bindings` | Each current role/state/version and verified user binding; decide the exact per-business grants and an active Owner/succession for each resulting boundary. Never infer intent from an old shared role. |
| `workspace_invitations` | Pending/accepted/expired/revoked invitations, inviter and intended business. Pending ambiguous invitations must be explicitly revoked/reissued for a chosen business; never clone them. |
| `workspace_bootstraps`, `identity_sessions` | Historical receipt payload/result and selected entity/container. Preserve authorized receipt recovery; plan explicit session revocation/reselection if any approved mapping changes. |
| `legacy_entity_claims`, `bookkeeping_cutovers`, migration provenance | Exact approved entity/profile/source/owner/binding hashes and authority. A new container invalidates the old approval context; obtain a new explicit claim decision without changing ledger identity or activating authority. |
| `external_connections`, document metadata/locations and private secret custody | Exact entity/container/profile/provider/folder/grant relationship. Preserve bytes and original scopes. A shared or unclear grant blocks conversion until its owner chooses a supported isolated binding. Never copy a refresh token or broaden receipt access. |
| `support_grants`, `support_actions` | Organization/entity/environment scope and retained privileged history. Revoke or explicitly reapprove access rather than carrying shared administrative authority into a new business. |

## Multi-business reconciliation

There is deliberately no automatic splitter. A failed preflight or constraint
upgrade leaves the old data and revision intact; repeated attempts have the
same result until an independently authorized operator resolves the conflict.
The migration locks the binding table before checking, so no concurrent writer
can slip a second binding between preflight and constraint installation.

1. Preserve a verified database/document recovery point and read-only private
   inventory of the exact environment. Pause relevant writers before planning
   the final change. Keep canonical entity IDs, accounting rows, document bytes,
   provenance, grants and current ownership unchanged during inventory.
2. Obtain explicit per-business owner approval for each membership, role,
   invitation, sole-owner succession, provider/receipt binding and session
   decision above. If intent or grant ownership cannot be disambiguated, stop;
   retain the source unchanged and keep the affected conversion blocked.
3. Prepare a narrowly scoped, forward-only operator migration with exact old
   and intended mappings, expected-state guards, recovery checkpoint and
   approval reference. Existing ownership-update and composite foreign-key
   guards intentionally prohibit casual reparenting. This needs a separately
   reviewed migration for the approved case, including receipts, claims,
   connections and support references; disabling triggers or deleting bindings
   to make this migration pass is not a supported reconciliation procedure.
   Do not merge tenants, clone shared memberships, choose a new Owner, reset a
   database or delete an entity as an implicit implementation choice.
4. Rehearse that explicit plan on an isolated authorized copy. Verify identical
   canonical exports/IDs, document metadata and bytes, provenance, grants,
   per-business roles, invitations, last-owner constraints and session/receipt
   behavior. Retain detailed evidence privately; publish only sanitized counts,
   fingerprints, revision and approved outcome. Execute on a live target only
   after separate exact-target operator authorization.
5. Repeat inventory and the constraint upgrade. Verify the expected schema and
   independent access for at least two businesses. Keep the preserved source
   and recovery material; no automatic cleanup or downgrade follows success.

## Deploy and rollback sequencing

For named-user staging and owner migration, inspect the exact schema and
read-only inventory first. If ambiguous, stop rollout and use the process
above. Do not treat staging fixtures or existing owner data as disposable.

Pause application and operator writers for the approved migration window. Apply
the explicit normal PostgreSQL forward upgrade through `0016_business_tenancy`,
then deploy this compatible backend before enabling business-first clients.
The old bootstrap contract remains callable; old additional-business controls
receive a safe forbidden response. The replacement onboarding uses a fresh
container for every business. This does not require identity/provider rotation
or rewrite valid sessions, grants, claims, ledger data or default records.

Smoke-test named login, existing selected entity, independent roles, read/write
and denied operations, invitation acceptance, receipt scope, fresh creation and
exact retry. Compare schema, canonical export and document recovery evidence
with the preserved baseline. The migration is forward-only. Roll back only to
an independently verified image that supports the retained new schema and
denies additions; a pre-pivot image is not automatically compatible. If no such
image exists, stop writers and deploy a compatible forward fix or use the
approved isolated database/document recovery procedure. Never drop the unique
constraint, reset data or reactivate stale Sheets as routine rollback.

The final browser revision additionally needs business-member and invitation review
APIs before its assets are promoted. Verify Owner A/Admin B and a Read-only recipient
shared by two independent Owners, flat list selection/refresh, role change and
revocation, peer-tab drafts/uploads/receipt cleanup, forged private requests and
long names at desktop/390px/320px. Retain revision, schema, route, browser, viewport,
safe timing/status and current-head required CI/review references in the owning
release discussion. Prior workspace/shared-role evidence does not establish this
model. Hosted provider recovery/rollback and owner binding/authority activation
remain separate; this UI neither changes approved historical entity/claim IDs nor
executes the owner cutover.

The existing narrowly scoped hosted support-schema maintenance command targets
its original transition; it is not approval to upgrade business tenancy. Use
an explicitly reviewed deployment migration for this revision. Owner source
claims and production authority still require their separate exact-target
cutover and connection approvals. This foundation supplies no alpha bypass,
live conversion, external-beta admission or commercial launch authorization.
