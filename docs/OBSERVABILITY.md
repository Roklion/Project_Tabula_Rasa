# Commercial operational observability

Issue #332 supplies diagnostic telemetry for epic #223 within initiative #124.
It does not activate a hosted destination, jobs, a release, or commercial recovery
promises. #224/#298 retain stage acceptance and operator sign-off. Ordinary
local development needs no telemetry account or secret.

## Inventory and ownership

| Existing owner | Reused hook and current gap closed |
| --- | --- |
| `http/app.py`, #277 | Server request ID, templated routes, safe error envelopes, live/ready/version; now structured level, stage, outcome, operation, error grouping and trusted pseudonymous context. |
| `http/serve.py`, #279 | Disabled raw Uvicorn access logs; now enables the safe INFO console sink. Runtime startup failure has a release-correlated diagnostic signal. |
| Render image/release workflows, #279 | Immutable release ID, deployment failure status, ordered migration/smoke/rollback. Provider notifications and failed Actions runs remain the deploy alert path; startup/readiness do not migrate. |
| PostgreSQL/Neon | Existing connectivity/schema-head readiness and connection limits; pool timeout and PostgreSQL connection exhaustion now have a safe diagnostic classification. Inspect Neon capacity/compute charts and existing migration checks to distinguish outages from wrong schema. |
| #312/#313 identity/authorization | Reuses login success/failure, logout/local clearing/failure, all-session revoke and identity/authorization denials. Adds cross-entity/capability/CSRF reason without a foreign selector. Provider failure on a callback is a failure even though the browser receives HTTP 303. |
| Document services/HTTP | Existing errors, upload/link/unlink/recovery and tenant isolation remain authoritative. Document errors identify the dependency without object keys, names or bytes. #337 owns the new managed adapter. |
| Browser | Existing `RouteError`, `ErrorNotice`, `ApiError` use safe messages/request IDs. No browser SDK, replay, console harvesting, URL or draft capture is enabled. Client-only crashes retain the existing safe fallback; server diagnostics do not claim to observe them. |
| Jobs/backup/audit | The #333 queue foundation now exists; its CLI/durable attempt diagnostics remain authoritative. The shared `job_run`/`backup_run` seam is available for producer integration and #334 recurring handlers. #294 now supplies the NAS runner, verified-generation health, hourly status task and independent missing-run notification checkpoint; central ingestion does not replace that path. #335 owns immutable, atomic business mutation history separately. |

The shared owner is `tabula_rasa/telemetry.py`; adapters supply only metadata
from registered server actions and already validated context. There is no new
business workflow, transaction manager or retry mechanism.

## Contract and privacy

Each request emits one JSON object, `schema_version=1`, with UTC `dt`,
`event=http_request`, server-generated `request_id`, stage/release, registered
`operation`, route **template**, bounded method/status/duration, safe
`failure_code`, `outcome`, `level`, `provider`/`provider_status`, and optional
security event/reason/action. `error_group` groups operation plus safe code;
request IDs are searchable attributes, never metric/group labels. Exceptions
are tracked through these groups, counts, release filters and correlation;
raw stacks, locals and exception messages are intentionally excluded. This is
log-based error tracking, not a claim that a native exception SDK is installed.

Actor, organization, entity, job and incoming correlation references are HMAC
SHA-256 pseudonyms truncated to 24 hex characters with kind/environment domain
separation. Scope comes from server-resolved context, including the caller's
permitted scope on a rejected cross-entity request, never the requested foreign
ID. A missing key omits references; a different key/environment changes them.
Login success can include its authenticated actor; failures never infer an actor
from an email, cookie or submitted claim. Logout does not perform an additional
session read just to enrich telemetry during an outage.

Never include emails, passwords, tokens, cookies, request/response bodies, raw
URLs/queries, filenames, workbook IDs, complete document keys, record IDs,
ledger values or receipt bytes. Caller correlation headers are pseudonymized,
not trusted as safe merely because they match a regular expression. Unknown
operations, routes, codes and security labels are dropped or mapped to a fixed
fallback. Metric dimensions are only stage, operation, status class, safe code,
provider and outcome. Keep release as a diagnostic filter; never use pseudonyms,
request/job IDs, error messages or raw paths as time-series dimensions.

Diagnostic security logs are mutable/expiring operational evidence owned by the
service operator. They are **not immutable accounting audit history**. #335 owns
same-transaction bookkeeping events, their accounting access controls and
separate retention policy. Telemetry access never grants ledger access.

## Collection, tier and manual setup checkpoint

The default sink is one JSON line to the process console. Render captures it;
local developers can inspect it directly. Do not enable raw HTTP/access logs,
SQL echo, debug tracebacks or unrestricted workspace log forwarding.

The selected optional collection path is a dedicated Better Stack HTTP log
source per environment. It receives exactly the sanitized event sent to the
console. No SDK instrumentation, additional dependency, backend application
framework or paid upgrade is required by this implementation.

Provider evaluation checked October 16, 2026:
[Render log retention](https://render.com/docs/logging) documents 7 days for
Hobby; [Neon monitoring](https://neon.com/docs/introduction/monitoring) supplies
provider-side capacity inspection. [Better Stack pricing](https://betterstack.com/pricing)
lists a personal-project free allowance of 3 GB logs/month with 3-day retention
and 10 monitors/heartbeats with email/Slack alerts. Its applicability to the
operator/account must be confirmed before commercial use. These short windows
are technical-stage limits, not commercial retention commitments. Monitor
volume/headroom and set a spending limit; do not authorize charges or buy a plan
implicitly. Retention, private project access and eligible features must be
read back from the actual account before hosted acceptance.

Operator checkpoint (not performed by source changes):

1. Approve the account/project, region, personal/commercial eligibility, current
   tier, private access and retention. Name a primary operator and alternate.
   Use separate development/staging/production sources and source tokens.
2. Create an HTTP source. Copy its source-specific HTTPS ingestion origin
   ending in `.betterstackdata.com` (no path, port or trailing slash). Place
   `TABULA_RASA_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` and `TABULA_RASA_TELEMETRY_TOKEN` together in
   the exact Render service's runtime secret configuration. The token must be
   a source token, not an account-management token.
3. Generate at least 32 random characters for
   `TABULA_RASA_TELEMETRY_SCOPE_KEY`, independently per environment. Store it as
   a runtime secret. Rotation breaks reference continuity intentionally. Do not
   put values in GitHub, images, browser `VITE_*`, command arguments or artifacts.
4. Grant diagnostic read access only to the named operator/alternate. No public
   dashboard/shared log links. Limit account administration separately. Accept
   3-day collector/7-day console retention for this stage or explicitly approve
   a different eligible plan/window. Do not change NAS backup retention here.
5. Set the alerts below in the private dashboard; approve and verify the actual
   email/Slack destination and alternate. No recipient is supplied by code.
   Read back source routing, retention, alert criteria and escalation settings.
6. Deploy only through the existing approved release process. Verify release,
   successful ingestion, denied-request redaction, notification and recovery.
   Save only safe release/request/incident references as evidence. A configured
   token or green unit test alone is not hosted alert acceptance.

[HTTP ingestion](https://betterstack.com/docs/logs/ingesting-data/http/logs/)
accepts JSON batches and confirms them with HTTP 202. A 128-event memory queue,
32-event maximum batch, one worker and bounded network timeouts isolate delivery
from requests. Redirects, environment proxies, cookies and retries are disabled.
There is no local spool or business-data copy. Quota rejection, failed transport,
initialization failure or queue saturation produces a fixed local
`telemetry_delivery` error, at most once per minute. No exporter exception,
response body or credential is logged. Shutdown waits at most four seconds and
may discard queued diagnostics; dropped events cannot be claimed delivered.
Use Render console plus an independent uptime monitor when the collector fails.
Delivery never changes the real HTTP/business result, retries a mutation, or
turns a failed operation into success. Both endpoint/token absent selects
console-only mode; partial/invalid configuration fails startup safely.

## Metrics, alerts and first triage

Use the private source's JSON fields for log-derived metrics. Save request count,
5xx count/rate, latency p95, dependency failures, denial count and readiness
status. For example, in the source SQL editor (select the environment's source):

```sql
SELECT
  JSONExtract(raw, 'operation', 'Nullable(String)') AS operation,
  count() AS requests,
  countIf(JSONExtract(raw, 'status', 'Nullable(Int64)') >= 500) AS failures,
  quantile(0.95)(JSONExtract(raw, 'duration_ms', 'Nullable(Float64)')) AS p95_ms
FROM {{source}}
WHERE {{time}} AND JSONExtract(raw, 'event', 'Nullable(String)') = 'http_request'
GROUP BY operation
```

Use [dashboard alerts](https://betterstack.com/docs/logs/dashboards/alerts/)
with explicit missing-data handling and one incident per stage/signal, not per
request or entity. The following are initial technical-stage settings to
validate and tune, not claimed SLOs:

| Signal / condition | Initial alert and recovery | First action / owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP 5xx (`event=http_request`, `status>=500`, excluding probes) | At least 5 in 5 minutes, or >=5% of at least 20 requests; healthy for 5 minutes resolves | Operator: group by safe error code/operation, compare release, find request ID in console. Never retry an uncertain save blindly. |
| External `/health/ready` !=200/unreachable | Check every 60s, incident after 3 failures, recover after 2 successes | Operator: inspect Render deploy/console, Neon connectivity/capacity/schema revision. Missing data is failure. |
| Deployment/migration failure | Existing Render deploy failure email + GitHub failed release workflow; immediate, manually disposition | Release operator: inspect ordered migration/image checks and compatible rollback in deployment guide; a previous live version is not candidate success. |
| `provider=postgresql`, `provider_status=exhausted` | >=1 in 5 minutes; recover after 5 minutes without another | Operator: compare pool cap and Neon connections, investigate leaks/traffic before increasing capacity. |
| `provider=identity`, `failure_code=unavailable` (including 303) | >=3 in 5 minutes, healthy for 5 minutes | Identity operator: check provider availability/configuration; preserve local logout/revocation semantics. |
| `provider=documents`, `outcome=failure`, `failure_code=unavailable` | >=3 in 5 minutes, healthy for 5 minutes | Document operator: inspect binding/provider state; preserve recoverable uploads and receipt bytes. |
| `telemetry_delivery` or ingestion absent during known probe traffic | >=1 notice, or no readiness log for 10 minutes | Operator: Render console, token/quota/source; independent uptime alert remains active if collection stops. Do not alert on ordinary idle tenant traffic. |
| Security denials | >=20 denials in 5 minutes per stage; 5-minute recovery | Operator: compare action/reason/release and pseudonymous caller context, without reconstructing foreign IDs. |
| Recurring/job failure (#333/#334) | On terminal failure; otherwise >=3 failed runs in 15 minutes; explicit successful run resolves | Job owner must emit `job_run`/`job_execute`, truthful outcome/provider status and pseudonymous stable job reference. The #333 queue exists; producer telemetry and #334 recurring handler integration must connect confirmed durable outcomes. This PR does not activate a worker. |
| Missing backup (#294) | Existing hourly `wrapper status` reports failed/missing/stale/capacity/overdue nonzero; the due generation becomes stale after the existing 2-hour grace. Verified healthy status resolves | NAS operator registers abnormal-exit notification plus an independent missing-NAS check-in or recorded operator check. Preserve Sunday/Wednesday 22:00 America/New_York and DST; API startup never stands in for a backup. |

Free Render cold starts/suspension and Neon idle compute can exceed probe
thresholds. Record those accepted limitations or choose approved continuous
capacity; monitoring itself can consume free compute hours. Do not mask an
outage or claim paid availability from a personal free allowance. For request
alerts, no traffic is zero, not an incident. For uptime/backup absence it is an
incident. The future #340 runbook should consume these safe trails and the
existing [deployment](COMMERCIAL_DEPLOYMENT.md),
[NAS health/notification](NAS_POSTGRESQL_BACKUP.md#nas-command-and-schedule) and
[recovery](POSTGRESQL_RECOVERY.md) procedures. NAS status output contains its
protected source/generation metadata: use only its exit state for notification,
never forward its whole JSON or backup config to the HTTP collector. Keep its
stdlib-only image independent of the web runtime. A future central adapter must
use the shared allowlist and a separate source, without changing backup results.

## Local and staging exercise

Local regression coverage uses synthetic services and a fake exporter:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/http/test_observability.py tests/http/test_transport.py tests/http/test_authorization.py
```

On restricted synthetic staging only, privately export its ordinary HTTP/alpha
settings and smoke password as for the existing deployment smoke. Run:

```powershell
python -m tabula_rasa.deployment.observability_smoke --release EXPECTED_RELEASE
```

The command checks `/version`, triggers a controlled foreign-synthetic entity
403, then reads the permitted synthetic accounts and readiness (200). It prints
only release, statuses and generated request IDs. It never writes, dumps
responses or adds a public crash endpoint. Temporarily set a **staging-only**
alert to one `security_reason=cross_entity` event in a one-minute window,
confirmation 0, recovery after one clear window. Confirm the incident arrives
at the approved recipient, find its request/release, verify only the permitted
scope pseudonym, then observe recovery and restore the normal threshold. Keep
credentials out of evidence. Test 5xx grouping/readiness recovery locally;
a real provider outage/deploy/backup failure rehearsal belongs to its owner and
requires a separately controlled staging procedure, not breaking the live DB.

For named-user staging, reuse #312/#320's approved synthetic identity sessions
and exercise a denied capability/cross-entity request plus an allowed read;
this alpha-only CLI deliberately refuses named mode. Verify login success,
provider-denied login, unavailable callback, logout and revoke with their
existing tests/runbook. #341 must emit `privileged_denied` for future
backup/restore/admin capability failures, using only registered safe actions,
trusted references and request/release context. It must not fabricate support
authority or log a submitted target. Job and NAS integrations must emit only confirmed run
results; #337 owns adapter-specific failures; #342 consumes hosted evidence.

Hosted setup, notification delivery and staging smoke remain an operator
checkpoint until safe evidence is recorded. #332 foundation tests do not close
#223, #124, #342 or the commercial release gate.
