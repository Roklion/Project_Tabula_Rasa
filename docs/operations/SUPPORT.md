# Least-privilege support operations

Support tooling provides narrowly scoped internal operations with explicit
operator and entity authorization. Production provisioning and hosted verification
require human approval. These commands do not activate writers, configure billing
or establish release acceptance.

## Authority and supported use cases

Support staff use a named-user session and the restricted HTTP CLI. They need
no SQL, provider credentials, secret-store access or tenant impersonation.
The server revalidates the session, environment epoch, active identity and an
unexpired, unrevoked grant for the exact organization on every operation.
Organization/entity binding comes from PostgreSQL, independently of the selected
browser business. There is no global organization search or tenant enumeration.

A grant provides read-only metadata diagnostics and audit inspection. Its
separate `can_admin` flag permits only the preview/confirm access-containment
commands below. No tenant role, including Owner/Admin, acquires either grant.
Existing Owner/Admin member administration remains owned by the workspace
service; Editor/Reader have no extra backup, restore, credential, local profile
or audit authority. Existing recovery commands still require their independent
platform capabilities and one-execution approvals. Support grants confer none
of those capabilities. Legacy loopback-only Account settings stays separate.

| Use case | Returned metadata / effect |
| --- | --- |
| Organization/entity lookup | Exact supplied IDs, organization state; no global directory or customer/billing details |
| Account lookup | Up to 100 IDs, types, classifications and active flags; no names, balances or postings |
| Membership/session diagnosis | Up to 100 member IDs, roles, member/user state and active session counts for this organization/environment |
| Failed jobs | Latest 100 job IDs, registered type, state, attempts and fixed failure code; no job payload or idempotency key |
| Migration diagnosis | Latest 100 run IDs and states; no source paths, manifest or ledger contents |
| Document connection health | Persisted provider/status only; no network probe, grant, folder, secret reference or receipt locator |
| Export status | `synchronous_not_retained`: financial CSV exports are synchronous; there is no durable export job/status history to fabricate |
| Audit inspection | At most 100 metadata events per request with explicit continuation; no before/after values, row digests or document bytes |
| Revoke sessions | Revoke the target member's sessions currently selected into this organization and environment; other businesses/environments survive |
| Suspend member | Inactivate only that organization membership through the existing control plane; active-owner protections still apply |
| Suspend organization | Suspend the exact organization; no automatic reactivation or user-global disable |

Revoking sessions alone does not remove membership: another surviving session
or a new login can still access authorized businesses. Use membership suspension
for lasting organization access containment, or the separately approved identity
incident procedure for a compromised global identity. No support command can
restore, migrate, reset books, change credentials, fetch ledger rows or download
receipts. Administrative plans bind exact scope, reason, operation, target and
current relevant state. A changed membership or session set invalidates a stale
plan. Confirmed session rows stay locked until commit, and the update targets
only their immutable cache IDs. Sessions arriving or switching into the business
after that boundary remain outside the confirmed set; inspect and preview again
if further containment is needed. Preview is default; applying requires the
returned plan hash.

## CLI and bounded audit export

From a development environment with the API dependencies installed:

```powershell
python -m scripts.support_diagnostics diagnostics --origin https://approved.example.test --organization APPROVED_ORG --entity APPROVED_ENTITY --reason incident
python -m scripts.support_diagnostics audit --origin https://approved.example.test --organization APPROVED_ORG --entity APPROVED_ENTITY --reason audit_review --since 2026-10-01T00:00:00Z --until 2026-11-01T00:00:00Z --limit 50
python -m scripts.support_diagnostics suspend_member --origin https://approved.example.test --organization APPROVED_ORG --entity APPROVED_ENTITY --reason access_request --target-user APPROVED_USER
```

Use only the operator's own authenticated session/CSRF credentials, supplied via
hidden prompts. Never put cookies in arguments, tickets, shell history or logs.
The CLI accepts HTTPS origins (HTTP only for loopback development), refuses
redirects and prints a generic failure rather than proxy/provider response text.
It never asks for database or secret-store credentials.

Repeat the exact administrative preview command with
`--confirm-plan RETURNED_PLAN_SHA256` only after reviewing the exact target and
approved containment action. A lost response is uncertain: inspect metadata and
audit history before deciding whether to preview again.

Audit filters include `--since` (inclusive), `--until` (exclusive), entity via
`--entity`, `--actor-id`, `--source`, `--action` (create/update/delete),
`--target-type`, `--target-id`, `--batch-id` and `--operation-id`.
Dates require an explicit timezone. Use returned `next_sequence` with
`--after-sequence` and keep the first response's `through_sequence` as
`--through-sequence`; this upper bound stops the traversal chasing its own
inspection events. Concurrent transactions can commit out of sequence; these
pages are diagnostic inspection, not a complete transactional snapshot export.
Each invocation exports at most 100 events and never
automatically follows pages. A full final page may require one more query.
Redirect successful JSON to an approved private incident evidence location only.
Repeated authorized requests remain possible; the page bound is not a claim
of a lifetime export quota. Metadata diagnostics return bounded samples, not a
complete inventory for organizations with more than 100 records.

POST routes are `/api/v1/support/{organization_id}/{business_id}/diagnostics`,
`/audit` and `/administration`. They use the existing named cookie, Origin and
CSRF checks and typed, redacted response contracts. Bodies require an allowlisted
reason code: incident, access_request, job_failure, migration_failure,
connection_failure or audit_review. No arbitrary free text is stored.

Every successful diagnostic/audit query, administrative preview and applied action
writes an immutable `support_actions` record and a same-transaction atomic audit history
event. A failed audit insert rolls back the administrative effect. Applied actions,
targets, reasons and approved provisioning details remain in immutable records. Audit
responses label support operation/reason but omit financial summaries. Denied requests
use operational observability's safe telemetry; no raw tenant IDs, submitted reason
text, credentials or receipt contents enter logs. Deployment-wide telemetry activation
and recipient approval retain operational observability ownership. Audit recovery must
include support actions and grants in complete PostgreSQL recovery; ordinary v1
financial exports deliberately omit them. History from before activation retains atomic
audit history's truthful unavailable boundary.

## Manual provisioning and revocation checkpoint

Only the production database administrator runs
`python -m scripts.provision_support_operator`, using separately protected
operator database access and the exact approved database binding. Support staff
must never receive that connection. Migration `0015_support_controls` creates
no grants and changes no tenant role or bookkeeping field.

1. Obtain human approval for the environment, organization/entity, existing named
   operator user ID, read-only or administrative authority, explicit expiry and
   sanitized approval reference. Confirm the administrator's own named user ID.
   Arrange the alternate operator and private incident record before live changes.
2. Follow [deployment/rollback](DEPLOYMENT.md), apply the normal
   forward migration in the approved maintenance window and deploy compatible
   API code. The runtime needs SELECT on support_grants and support_actions,
   INSERT on support_actions and its existing scoped identity/session DML and audit
   SELECT permissions. Grant no support-grant writes, audit-event writes or table
   ownership to the runtime; its support INSERT policy requires the trusted
   entity/operator context. Provisioning uses the separate database administrator.
   Do not treat this documentation as provisioning authorization.
3. Preview with `--administrator ADMIN_USER --user OPERATOR_USER --organization
   APPROVED_ORG --entity APPROVED_ENTITY --environment production
   --approval-reference APPROVED_REFERENCE --expires-at APPROVED_ISO_INSTANT`.
   These are arguments to `python -m scripts.provision_support_operator`.
   Read-only is default; add `--admin` only for an approved containment operator.
   No identity, role, session, provider secret or tenant membership is created.
4. Review the exact binding/approval and repeat with
   `--confirm-plan RETURNED_PLAN_SHA256`. Provisioning and its immutable event
   commit together. Preserve the private approval separately; the reference
   contains only letters, digits, underscores or hyphens, never private text.
5. Verify the operator can inspect the approved business and cannot inspect a
   second synthetic organization or access ledger/document content. Verify
   revocation, denial telemetry and immutable event visibility on the deployed
   revision. Use synthetic data for hosted validation.
6. For rollback or lost authority, preview the same administrator command with
   `--revoke` and the exact user/org/environment/approval reference; review and
   confirm its plan. This works for a disabled operator too. Existing sessions
   immediately lose support access at the next request; retained tenant
   membership is independent. Use expiry as a further bound, not as a substitute
   for emergency revocation.

Forward-only rollback keeps history and schema: revoke grants, stop support access and
select an approved compatible release. Do not drop support/audit tables or reverse
bookkeeping. Use [incident response](INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md), [secret/session
containment](SECRETS.md), and [recovery verification](DATABASE_RECOVERY.md) for wider
incidents. operational readiness verification consumes sanitized current-release
evidence, named primary/alternate operators, observed limitations and unresolved hosted
checks; external release and customer lifecycle and commercial recovery agreement retain
release authority.

## Synthetic privileged-denial client

For a separately approved synthetic drill without credential handoff, use the
opt-in Node 24 operator command below from the repository root. Install the locked
web tooling with `npm --prefix web ci` and its Chromium engine with
`npm --prefix web exec -- playwright install chromium` first. This is a standalone
command, never a Playwright test-runner invocation or product navigation feature.

```powershell
node web/support-denial.ts --origin https://APPROVED_SYNTHETIC_ORIGIN --release EXACT_40_HEX_SHA --organization APPROVED_ORG --business APPROVED_BUSINESS --approval PRIVATE_APPROVAL_REFERENCE --synthetic-approved --consent-one-request
```

The operator must already hold an external approval record for the exact HTTPS
origin, immutable release, existing synthetic named identity and organization/
business, window, one-request budget and private evidence custody. `--approval`
is only an opaque reference (letters/digits/underscore/hyphen); the command cannot
verify that record or prove staging from a hostname or SHA. Flags attest approval;
they do not grant it. Confirm there is **no support grant**; do not provision or
revoke one to make this exercise pass. No account, secret or deployment changes
are part of this command.

It opens its own ephemeral Chromium context. Complete ordinary human login/MFA
and select the approved existing business in that browser, then type the fixed
one-request consent phrase in the terminal. Do not enter credentials in the
terminal. The client checks `/version` and the authorized ready named session's
organization/business claims, rejects setup/alpha/anonymous or mismatched scope,
and sends one fixed diagnostics POST with reason `incident`. Browser-managed
cookies and Origin plus session-response CSRF stay in that context; no credential
or storage state is exported. Other application API traffic is blocked except
login, session/business choices and explicit business selection, so ordinary
dashboard financial requests may show errors during selection.

Run without debug/inspector environment settings. The standalone command enables
no trace, HAR, video, screenshot, download, request/response logging or reporter;
do not add recording wrappers or developer-tools captures. It closes the context
and browser on completion/failure. Expected output is fixed `expected_forbidden`
or `refused`, verified release (or null), a validated server request ID (or null),
and `collector_and_notification: unverified`. Redirects, malformed/oversized
responses, unsafe IDs, wrong scope and unexpected success fail without dumping
contents or retrying. After any failure or uncertain request, inspect independently;
rerunning consumes a new budget and needs a new approval.

**HTTP 403 alone does not prove `privileged_denied` or alert delivery.** An
independent authorized operator must correlate the safe request ID/release with
the actual collector event, correct pseudonymous scope and approved recipient's
delivered incident. CSRF `authorization_denied` is not equivalent. One request
does not satisfy the normal security-denial alert threshold; approve any isolated
threshold change separately and restore it under the [drill procedure](INCIDENT_DRILLS.md#dependency-and-job-drill-preflight).
Keep actual outcomes in the owning issue/PR and private incident record, not in
repository evidence reports. Source tests and client output prove no hosted
execution, notification, stage readiness or launch acceptance.

## Reuse and validation

The implementation extends identity control plane and server authorization's existing
users, sessions, memberships and last-owner guards, durable job queue's job diagnostic
contract, atomic audit history's private `AuditReader` and atomic append-only event
triggers, and operational observability HTTP telemetry. New ownership is limited to
expiring scoped support grants, bounded redacted DTOs, confirmation plans and immutable
support-action records. It introduces no second identity store, role system, accounting
engine, scheduler, document provider or recovery state machine.

Run `tests/postgres/test_support_controls.py` against disposable PostgreSQL, plus
affected identity/authorization/audit/migration/export/recovery checks,
`tests/test_support_cli.py`, Ruff and generated API contract/type checks. Tests cover
two tenants, revoked/expired/wrong-environment authority, stale plans, scoped session
revocation, last-owner refusal, unsafe direct actions, redacted output/logs, grant
provisioning and atomic audit failure. Local synthetic evidence does not establish
hosted production provisioning or external release and customer lifecycle and commercial
recovery agreement release acceptance.

### Implementation evidence and operational handoff

Reviewed implementation, local diagnostics and current-candidate CI/reviewer results are
recorded in [support implementation
evidence](https://github.com/Roklion/Project_Tabula_Rasa/issues/341) and [PR
#396](https://github.com/Roklion/Project_Tabula_Rasa/pull/396). [operational readiness
verification](AUDIT_RECOVERY.md) owns actual operator provisioning, deployed
denial/telemetry observations and primary/alternate operator execution. [operational
observability](OBSERVABILITY.md) retains hosted telemetry activation. Code/test delivery
does not establish that operational handoff or external release and customer lifecycle
and commercial recovery agreement release acceptance.
